1.git clone from https://github.com/TimorBibi/Testing-Equality-in-Communication-Graphs

2.cd into the project directory - “Testing-Equality-in-Communication-Graphs”

3.Install project dependencies: “npm install” / “yarn install.

4.Run the application: “npm start” / “yarn start”.(May take a few seconds)

5.Enter number of vertices as you please.

6.Check the wanted edges at the adjacency matrix.

7.Create graph and look for the limits at the bottom of the page.


-Notes: 

C222 algorithm = 2-edge connected graph G in which no two vertices of degree bigger than 2
are adjacent.
